DEVANSHU KHAKHAR,

I am writing to sincerely apologize for my actions and for the hurt or inconvenience they caused you. After reflecting on the situation, I realize that I made a mistake, and I take full responsibility for it.

I understand how my behavior affected you, and I regret that my actions did not reflect the respect and consideration you deserve. That was never my intention, but I recognize that intent does not erase impact.

Please know that I am truly sorry. I am committed to learning from this experience and to doing better moving forward. I value our relationship and hope that, in time, you can find it in your heart to forgive me.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I appreciate your understanding and hope we can move forward positively.

Sincerely,
DEVANSHU KHAKHAR.
