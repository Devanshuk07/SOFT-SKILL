Subject: Request for Salary Review

Dear MANAGER-RAHUL DHOLAKIYA,

I hope you are doing well. I would like to request a meeting to discuss a review of my current salary.

Over the past 2years, I have taken on additional responsibilities and have consistently worked to meet and exceed expectations. I believe my contributions to the team and the value I bring to the organization justify a review of my compensation.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further at a time convenient for you. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to your feedback.

Kind regards,
Devanshu khakhar
Assistant Manager
